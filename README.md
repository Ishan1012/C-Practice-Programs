# C Programming Practice Files

Welcome to my collection of C programming practice files. These files demonstrate various C programming concepts and techniques that I've learned throughout my coursework. Each file is a standalone program that focuses on a specific topic or problem.

## Introduction

This repository contains practice C programs that I developed during my college coursework. The files cover a wide range of C programming topics such as:

- Basic Syntax and Data Types
- Control Flow (loops, conditionals)
- Functions
- Arrays and Pointers
- Strings
- File I/O
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Structures and Unions

Each file is well-documented with comments explaining the logic behind the code.

## Programs

Below is a list of the key programs in this repository:

| Filename          | Description                                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `hello_world.c`    | Basic program to print "Hello, World!"                 |
| `calculator.c`     | Simple calculator performing addition, subtraction, etc.|
| `factorial.c`      | Program to calculate the factorial of a given number   |
| `array_sort.c`     | Sorting an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm |
| `pointer_demo.c`   | Demonstrates the use of pointers in C                  |
| `file_io.c`        | Reading from and writing to a file                     |
| `dynamic_memory.c` | Example of dynamic memory allocation with `malloc()`   |
| `struct_example.c` | Demonstrates the use of structures in C                |

Feel free to browse the individual files for more information on each program.

## How to Compile and Run

You can compile and run any of these C programs using a C compiler such as `gcc`. Below are the steps to compile and execute a program:

1. **Compiling a Program**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to the folder containing the C file you want to compile. Use the following command to compile:

   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output_name
   ```

   Example for `hello_world.c`:

   ```bash
   gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world
   ```

2. **Running the Program**:
   After compilation, you can run the program using:

   ```bash
   ./output_name
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   ./hello_world
   ```
